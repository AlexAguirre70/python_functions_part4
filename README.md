# More fun Python Functions
* Write a Python function called max_num()to find the maximum of three numbers.
* Write a Python function called mult_list() to multiply all the numbers in a list.
* Write a Python function called rev_string() to reverse a string.
* Write a Python function called num_within() to check whether a number falls in a given range.<br><br>
The function accepts the number, beginning of range, and end of range (inclusive) as arguments.<br><br>
Examples: num_within(3,2,4) returns True, num_within(3,1,3) returns True, num_within(10,2,5) returns False.<br><br>
* Write a Python function called pascal() that prints out the first n rows of Pascal's triangle.<br><br>
The function accepts the number n, the number of rows to print<br><br>
Note : Pascal's triangle is an arithmetic and geometric figure first imagined by Blaise Pascal. Each number is the two numbers above it added together.
